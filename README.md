# Genome Fragmentation and SSR Study  

This project explores the impact of genome fragmentation and random sequence modification on genome assembly quality and SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) identification accuracy. It provides scripts for simulating genome fragmentation, inserting random characters into DNA sequences, and reformatting FASTA files.

## Features  

- **Random Sequence Modification:**  
  Insert random 'X' characters into DNA sequences to simulate errors or unknown regions.  

- **Genome Fragmentation:**  
  Fragment DNA sequences at 'X' insertion points, creating smaller segments for analysis.  

- **Utility Tool:**  
  Reformat multi-line FASTA files into single-line format for compatibility with scripts.
